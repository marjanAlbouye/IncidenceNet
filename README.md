# Incidence Networks for Geometric Deep Learning


# Dataset prepration

link to the original QM9 dataset: http://quantum-machine.org/datasets/
To prepare the dataset needed for training and evaluation run the following command at data_prep directory:
```python qm9_prep.py```

# Training and Evaluation

 To train and evaluate the model on a target run the following command at src directory.
